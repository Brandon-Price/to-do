# to-do
A simple to-do application to use as an excercise.<br><br>

Goals:
----------------
- I want to give myself a reason to learn nextjs and its file structure.
- More practice in using postgres.
- Use docker to get used to it more.
- Practice making cleaner css and html.
- (Maybe) Use typescript.
